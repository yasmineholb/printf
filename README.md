*This is about the making of the very well known function printf
*To start,for a the C programming languge, you should know that printf is a function that displays/prints a msg To the Std output
*for example if you wanna display : Hello, printf

		    All you gotta do is to type in your code is : _printf("Hello, printf");

*You can also display a variable in printf whith diffrent types (int/char/string/etc...)

     	      	    To display thoes varibales you need to type: %d for a decimal integer
		       	       	     	       	   	   	 %s for a string
								 %c for a char
								 %i for an integer
*Well printf is a varidac function so for each varible in your msg you gotta include it's name in an argument respectivly
		Example:
		char H[] = "Holberton";
		_printf("%s is Number:%d \n", H, 1);

			   To display: Holberton is Number:1
